## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main thing I learned during this challenge is how to work with variables, which I am now wishing I learned much sooner. Variables are incredibly powerful and save so much time, it's definitely something I can see myself using often in the future.

This challenge is also the first time I used the live site plugin in VSC and I absolutely love it, I cannot imagine coding without it now.

### Continued development

I really want to experiment more with variables, I want to see the limits of them if they even have any.

### Useful resources
